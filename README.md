Make sure that you change this dependency when running the test. 

      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.testng</groupId>
        <artifactId>arquillian-testng-standalone</artifactId>
        <version>1.4.2.Sarah-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </dependency>


The dummy tests are nested for loops. takes around 10 minutes if not run in parallel. 5 minutes if done with 5 threads. 

Using Arquillian Cube!
